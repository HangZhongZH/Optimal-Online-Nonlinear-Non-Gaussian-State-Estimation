%Introductions about the codes:

%% You can run the following main program for tasks:
% 'task_main.m' is for task 1
% 'EKFandIEKF_main.m' is for Kalman filter and Iterated Kalman filter for task2,3,4
% 'GDandGDRP_main.m' is for grid based method and improved grid based method for task2,3,4
% 'SIRandASIR_main.m' is for SIR particle filter and ASIR particle filter for task2,3,4





%% functions:
% 'State_updt.m' and 'Output_pred.m' are the state space model functions
% 'State_der.m' and 'Output_der.m' are the derivatives of state space model functions
% 'MTCL.m' is using Monte Carlo simulations to get the state distributions
% 'EKF.m' is extended Kalman filter algorithm
% 'IEKF.m' is iterated extended Kalman filter algorithm
% 'GD.m' and 'MAPGD.m' are grid based method
% 'GDRP.m' is improved grid based method
% 'SIR.m' is SIR particle filter algorithm
% 'ASIR.m' is ASIR particle filter algorithm
